5. Reported College Violent Sexual Asaults - https://nces.ed.gov/programs/crimeindicators/


Cleaning:
I cleaned the data using python. Dropped the duplicate cells, deleted the columns I did not need and then loaded them into pgyAdmin.
In pgAdmin I did a left join on the tables and then pulled the data back into python.
